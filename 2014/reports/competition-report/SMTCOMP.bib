  abstract	= {After 8 years of SMT Competitions, the SMT Steering
		  Committee decided, for 2013, to sponsor an evaluation of
		  the status of SMT benchmarks and solvers, rather than
		  another competition. This report summarizes the results of
		  the evaluation, conducted by the authors. The key
		  observations are that (1) the competition results are quite
		  sensitive to randomness and (2) the most significant need
		  for the future is assessment and improvement of benchmarks
		  in the light of SMT applications. The evaluation also
		  measured competitiveness of solvers, general coverage of
		  solvers, logics, and benchmarks, and degree of
		  repeatability of measurements and competitions.}
